Description: 
        Package xrt (XRayTracer) is a python software library for ray tracing and wave
        propagation in x-ray regime. It is primarily meant for modeling synchrotron
        sources, beamlines and beamline elements. Includes a GUI for creating a
        beamline and interactively viewing it in 3D.
        
        Features of xrt
        ---------------
        
        * *Rays and waves*. Classical ray tracing and wave propagation via Kirchhoff
          integrals, also freely intermixed. No further approximations, such as thin
          lens or paraxial. The optical surfaces may have figure errors, analytical or
          measured. In wave propagation, partially coherent radiation is treated by
          incoherent addition of coherently diffracted fields generated per electron.
        
        * *Publication quality graphics*. 1D and 2D position histograms are
          *simultaneously* coded by hue and brightness. Typically, colors represent
          energy and brightness represents beam intensity. The user may select other
          quantities to be encoded by colors: angular and positional distributions,
          various polarization properties, beam categories, number of reflections,
          incidence angle etc. Brightness can also encode partial flux for a selected
          polarization and incident or absorbed power. Publication quality plots are
          provided by matplotlib with image formats PNG, PostScript, PDF and SVG.
        
        * *Unlimited number of rays*. The colored histograms are *cumulative*. The
          accumulation can be stopped and resumed.
        
        * *Parallel execution*. xrt can be run in parallel in several threads or
          processes (can be opted), which accelerates the execution on multi-core
          computers. Alternatively, xrt can use the power of GPUs via OpenCL for
          running special tasks such as the calculation of an undulator source or
          performing wave propagation.
        
        * *Scripting in Python*. xrt can be run within Python scripts to generate a
          series of images under changing geometrical or physical parameters. The image
          brightness and 1D histograms can be normalized to the global maximum
          throughout the series.
        
        * *Synchrotron sources*. Bending magnet, wiggler, undulator and elliptic
          undulator are calculated internally within xrt. There is also a legacy
          approach to sampling synchrotron sources using the codes `ws` and `urgent`
          which are parts of XOP package. Please look the section "Comparison of
          synchrotron source codes" for the comparison between the implementations. If
          the photon source is one of the synchrotron sources, the total flux in the
          beam is reported not just in number of rays but in physical units of ph/s.
          The total power or absorbed power can be opted instead of flux and is
          reported in W. The power density can be visualized by isolines. The magnetic
          gap of undulators can be tapered. Undulators can be calculated in near field.
          Custom magnetic field is also possible. Undulators can be calculated on GPU,
          with a high gain in computation speed, which is important for tapering and
          near field calculations.
        
        * *Shapes*. There are several predefined shapes of optical elements implemented
          as python classes. The inheritance mechanism simplifies creation of other
          shapes. The user specifies methods for the surface height and the surface
          normal. For asymmetric crystals, the normal to the atomic planes can be
          additionally given. The surface and the normals are defined either in local
          (x, y) coordinates or in user-defined parametric coordinates. Parametric
          representation enables closed shapes such as capillaries or wave guides. It
          also enables exact solutions for complex shapes (e.g. a logarithmic spiral)
          without any expansion. The methods of finding the intersections of rays with
          the surface are very robust and can cope with pathological cases as sharp
          surface kinks. Notice that the search for intersection points does not
          involve any approximation and has only numerical inaccuracy which is set by
          default as 1 fm. Any surface can be combined with a (differently and variably
          oriented) crystal structure and/or (variable) grating vector. Surfaces can be
          faceted.
        
        * *Energy dispersive elements*. Implemented are crystals in dynamical
          diffraction, gratings (also with efficiency calculations), Fresnel zone
          plates, Bragg-Fresnel optics and multilayers in dynamical diffraction.
          Crystals can work in Bragg or Laue cases, in reflection or in transmission.
          The two-field polarization phenomena are fully preserved, also within the
          Darwin diffraction plateau, thus enabling the ray tracing of crystal-based
          phase retarders.
        
        * *Materials*. The material properties are incorporated using three different
          tabulations of the scattering factors, with differently wide and differently
          dense energy meshes. Refractive index and absorption coefficient are
          calculated from the scattering factors. Two-surface bodies, such as plates or
          refractive lenses, are treated with both refraction and absorption.
        
        * *Multiple reflections*. xrt can trace multiple reflections in a single
          optical element. This is useful, for example in 'whispering gallery' optics
          or in Montel or Wolter mirrors.
        
        * *Non-sequential optics*. xrt can trace non-sequential optics where different
          parts of the incoming beam meet different surfaces. Examples of such optics
          are poly-capillaries and Wolter mirrors.
        
        * *Singular optics*. xrt correctly propagates vortex beams, which can be used
          for studying the creation of vortex beams by transmissive or reflective
          optics.
        
        * *Global coordinate system*. The optical elements are positioned in a global
          coordinate system. This is convenient for modeling a real synchrotron
          beamline. The coordinates in this system can be directly taken from a CAD
          library. The optical surfaces are defined in their local systems for the
          user's convenience.
        
        * *Beam categories*. xrt discriminates rays by several categories: `good`,
          `out`, `over` and `dead`. This distinction simplifies the adjustment of
          entrance and exit slits. An alarm is triggered if the fraction of dead rays
          exceeds a specified level.
        
        * *Portability*. xrt runs on Windows and Unix-like platforms, wherever you can
          run python.
        
        * *Examples*. xrt comes with many examples; see the galleries, the links are at
          the top bar.
        
        xrtQook -- a GUI for creating scripts
        -------------------------------------
        
        The main interface to xrt is through a python script. Many examples of such
        scripts can be found in the supplied folder 'examples'. The script imports the
        modules of xrt, instantiates beamline parts, such as synchrotron or geometric
        sources, various optical elements, apertures and screens, specifies required
        materials for reflection, refraction or diffraction, defines plots and sets job
        parameters.
        
        The Qt tool xrtQook takes these ingredients and prepares a ready to use script
        that can be run within the tool itself or in an external Python context.
        xrtQook features a parallelly updated help panel that, unlike the main
        documentation, provides a complete list of parameters for the used classes,
        also including those from the parental classes. xrtQook writes/reads the
        recipes of beamlines into/from xml files.
        
        xrtGlow -- an interactive 3D beamline viewer
        --------------------------------------------
        
        The beamline created in xrtQook can be interactively viewed in an OpenGL based
        widget xrtGlow. It visualizes beams, footprints, surfaces, apertures and
        screens. The brightness represents intensity and the color represents an
        auxiliary user-selected distribution, typically energy. A virtual screen can be
        put at any position and dragged by mouse with simultaneous observation of the
        beam distribution on it.
        
        The primary purpose of xrtGlow is to demonstrate the alignment correctness
        given the fact that xrtQook can automatically calculate several positional and
        angular parameters.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        numpy, scipy and matplotlib are required. If you use OpenCL for calculations on
        GPU or CPU, you need AMD/NVIDIA drivers, ``Intel CPU only OpenCL runtime``
        (these are search key words), pytools and pyopencl. PyQt4 or PyQt5 are needed
        for xrtQook. Spyder (as library of Spyder IDE) is highly recommended for nicer
        view of xrtQook. OpenGL is required for xrtGlow.
        
        Python 2 and 3
        --------------
        The code can run in both Python branches without any modification.
