Version history
---------------

1.5.0 (8 Sep 2022):
    - Propagation of individual source modes, as waves, hybrid waves
      (partially as rays and then as waves) and only rays.
      See :ref:`Coherent mode decomposition and propagation <modes>`.

    - :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Multilayer` can now be used in
      transmission. See :ref:`the mathematical description <descr_ml_tran>`,
      :ref:`a few comparative test curves <tests_ml_tran>` and the test script
      ``tests/test_multilayer_transmission.py``.

    - Added elliptical Gaussian beam, see
      `here <https://github.com/kklmn/xrt/issues/96>`_.

    - Ray-tracing of mosaic crystals in reflected and transmitted geometry.
      See the test script ``tests/test_mosaic_xtal_thin.py``.

    - Minor bug fixes.

1.4.0 (22 Sep 2021):
    - Major update for the :ref:`undulator sources <undulator-grid>` module:

    - Custom synchrotron sources calculation extended for non-periodic cases,
      including bending magnets.

    - Multiple performance optimizations, Gauss-Legendre grid replaced with
      Clenshaw-Curtis. 
 
    - Extended functionality to :ref:`estimate and visualize convergence
      <test_undulator>`.

    - Added pure NumPy implementation for near field model and custom
      magnetic structures.

    - Added setters and getters, doing reset() is no longer required after
      post-init update of parameters.

    - Added asymmetric angular limits.

    - Angular limits get automatically extended to account for
      divergence/emittance, important if used with the slits/apertures
      matching angular acceptance.

    - Bug fixes and minor updates.

    - Several user stories made us insert warnings in the code and explanations
      in the :ref:`docs <mesh-methods>` about the proper usage of mesh-based
      methods of xrt Undulator.

    - Added custom orientation to apertures.

    - Added undulator source size from FT of the back propagated angular
      distribution (following Coïsson [Coïsson]_). The description to come in
      a paper about coherence properties.

1.3.0 (25 Mar 2018):
    - Addition of :ref:`xrtGlow <glow>` -- a 3D beamline viewer.

    - Almost all old examples can now be viewed in xrtGlow as well, just select
      a proper value for the switch `showIn3D`. Those example scripts having a
      generator for making scans can also save a movie -- a series of grabbed
      3D views, as e.g. in :ref:`here <balder_pitch>`.

    - The documentation has moved to
      `Read the Docs <http://xrt.readthedocs.io>`_.
      It loads much faster and builds automatically from GitHub xrt sources.

    - Added 'Chantler total' (see
      :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Material`) to the list of
      absorption tables. This table also adds inelastic scattering channels to
      the photoelectric absorption cross-section (thanks to B. Kozioziemski
      (LLNL) for discovering the need).

    - Added modelling of interdiffusion/roughness interface to
      :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Multilayer`. Added
      :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Coated` material -- a derivative
      class from :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Multilayer` with a
      single reflective layer on a substrate.

    - A new module :mod:`~xrt.backends.raycing.coherence` that has functions
      for 1D and 2D analysis of coherence and functions for 1D plotting of
      degree of coherence and 2D plotting of eigen modes. Reworked analysis of
      coherence in :ref:`SoftiMAX` example.
    
    - Added electron energy spread dependence to the linear and angular sizes
      of undulator source. See the :ref:`formulation <undulator-source-size>`
      and an :ref:`application example<example-undulator-sizes>`.

    - Added :ref:`tests of optical elements <test_oes>` which currently have
      a test for asymmetric crystal optics (phase space volume conservation)
      and a test with backscattering at highly asymmetric crystals (comparison
      with experiment).

1.2.1 (19 Sep 2016):
    - Added SRW to some comparisons of synchrotron sources. See :ref:`here
      <undulator_highE>`.

    - As the major browsers stop supporting flash animations, we have rebuilt
      all our animations on the documentation pages. The images are now
      animated in JavaScript and feature on spot zooming by mouse click (not in
      IE though). The total size of the images has become smaller at better
      image quality and bidirectional animations (doubled number of frames).

    - xrtQook works now with Qt versions up to 5.7.

    - Minor bug fixes and updates.

1.2.0 (09 Jul 2016):
    - We've created a repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/kklmn/xrt>`_.

    - Added custom field undulator, see :ref:`an example <undulator_custom>`.

    - Improved and optimized formulas of undulator source, resulting in correct
      behaviour at high energies, see :ref:`here <undulator_highE>`.

    - Prepared for singular optics (vortex beams): added GaussianBeam and
      LaguerreGaussianBeam as geometric sources. We have used them for testing
      our Kirchhoff integration. The tests demonstrate identical images in
      analytical and numerically diffracted fields, see
      :ref:`here <test-Laguerre-Gaussian>`.

    - Modified CRLs to get loops over the lenses internally by
      ``multiple_refract`` method. The number of lenses can also be calculated
      internally given energy, material and focal distance.

    - Several minor bug fixes and updates.

1.1.0 (26 Mar 2016):
    - :ref:`xrtQook <qook>` -- a GUI for creating scripts. Tested with Python 2
      and 3, PyQt4, PyQt5 and PySide, Windows and Linux.

    - The examples have been restructured such that the creation of plots and
      scan generators has moved into module-level functions. With this
      structure, the examples are better readable.

    - Re-written startup routines for running OpenCL codes.

    - Improved alignment of :ref:`highly asymmetric crystals <get_dtheta>`.

    - Several minor bug fixes and updates.

      mathematical formulas).

1.0.2 (21 Jan 2016):
    - :ref:`A new analysis method <coh_signs_PCA>` for the quantification of
      degree of coherence based on PCA. It is equivalent to the modal analysis
      but is much cheaper.

    - :ref:`Examples of usage of xrt as a library for x-ray calculations
      <calc>`.

    - :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Multilayer` can now be not only

      :ref:`slit <slitDiffraction>`, :ref:`double slit <YoungDiffraction>`,
      :ref:`grating <gratingDiffraction>` and :ref:`FZP <fzpDiffraction>`.

    - Diffraction efficiency of gratings and FZPs can now be calculated via
      wave diffraction. See the comparison with :ref:`REFLEC curves
      <gratingDiffraction>`.

    - Gratings and FZPs in ray tracing regime can now accept externally
      calculated efficiency weights per diffraction order, see
      :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.materials.Material`.

    - :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.oes.BlazedGrating` has been added.

      <dmm>`.

    - A new :ref:`example of von Hamos spectrometer in circular and elliptical
      shapes <elliptical_VonHamos>`.

    - :ref:`The example of Montel mirror <montel>` has been revised: we have

      colored by the number of reflections.

    - Export of plot attributes to Matlab has been added, see the parameter
      :ref:`persistentName <persistentName>`.

    - :class:`~xrt.backends.raycing.screens.HemisphericScreen` has been added.

    - Extra angles for OE misalignments.

    - The constructor of apertures has changed! It now has `center` field, as
      many other objects. Before, it had `x` and `y`. This change requires
      small modifications in old application scripts.

    - :ref:`Example of von Hamos spectrometer <VonHamos>` and comparison with
      Rowland circle based spectrometers.
