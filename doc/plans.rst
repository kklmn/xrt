Plans
-----

- propagation of individual source modes, both as waves and rays

- full propagation through the beamline completely within OpenCL

- models of isotropic fluorescence beams, including proper quantum fluorescence
  yield

- comparison of wave propagation with SRW

- scans and wave propagation in xrtQook

- dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction for bent crystals -- TT theory

- free electron lasers as sources
